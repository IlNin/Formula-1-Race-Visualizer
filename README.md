# Formula-1-Race-Visualizer
An unpolished, buggy but working prototype for the Visual Analytics' project. This was ultimately scrapped in favor of https://ilnin.github.io/Formula-1-Driver-Analyser, but I still wanted to upload it because I thought the idea of showing the progression of races like this was potentially interesting, especially when I could have added further features like visualizations of DNFs, pit stops and the ability to inspect subset of laps in order to quickly gain the fastest one and their average. Maybe one day!
